Mostly because I’m so dead tired all the time. Yesterday I fell asleep at eight while putting the kids to bed. After ten hours of sleep I woke rested and in the mood to draw a beautiful lady. I’ve had my eye on this #dtiys for quite some time.
            I love the colors, the effortless pose of the character, the well balanced lineart and the simplicity of it ♥️ ingenious!">

This is my version of that story 🥰">

Very refreshing and I quite like this piece. Loads of different references for this, hands, face, lighting etc. Loads of fun as well 😍 hope you like 😘">
